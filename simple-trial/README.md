# Simple Trial
This is a small, simple example with a single top-level main.c and a couple of libraries. The aim here is to investigate how the basic CMake flow works to generate a build system and to run it. Note that there is no cross-compilation here, it is all running on the host platform, so it is not mbed-os related at all.
